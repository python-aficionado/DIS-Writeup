  abstract = {Background: Dialog agents (chatbots) have a long history of application in health care, where they have been used for tasks such as supporting patient self-management and providing counseling. Their use is expected to grow with increasing demands on health systems and improving artificial intelligence (AI) capability. Approaches to the evaluation of health care chatbots, however, appear to be diverse and haphazard, resulting in a potential barrier to the advancement of the field. Objective: This study aims to identify the technical (nonclinical) metrics used by previous studies to evaluate health care chatbots. Methods: Studies were identified by searching 7 bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE and PsycINFO) in addition to conducting backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. The studies were independently selected by two reviewers who then extracted data from the included studies. Extracted data were synthesized narratively by grouping the identified metrics into categories based on the aspect of chatbots that the metrics evaluated. Results: Of the 1498 citations retrieved, 65 studies were included in this review. Chatbots were evaluated using 27 technical metrics, which were related to chatbots as a whole (eg, usability, classifier performance, speed), response generation (eg, comprehensibility, realism, repetitiveness), response understanding (eg, chatbot understanding as assessed by users, word error rate, concept error rate), and esthetics (eg, appearance of the virtual agent, background color, and content). Conclusions: The technical metrics of health chatbot studies were diverse, with survey designs and global usability metrics dominating. The lack of standardization and paucity of objective measures make it difficult to compare the performance of health chatbots and could inhibit advancement of the field. We suggest that researchers more frequently include metrics computed from conversation logs. In addition, we recommend the development of a framework of technical metrics with recommendations for specific circumstances for their inclusion in chatbot studies. },

  abstract = {Background: Synchronous written conversations (or ``chats'') are becoming increasingly popular as Web-based mental health interventions. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to evaluate and summarize the quality of these interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to review the current evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of online one-on-one mental health interventions that use text-based synchronous chat. Methods: A systematic search was conducted of the databases relevant to this area of research (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online [MEDLINE], PsycINFO, Central, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, IEEE, and ACM). There were no specific selection criteria relating to the participant group. Studies were included if they reported interventions with individual text-based synchronous conversations (ie, chat or text messaging) and a psychological outcome measure. Results: A total of 24 articles were included in this review. Interventions included a wide range of mental health targets (eg, anxiety, distress, depression, eating disorders, and addiction) and intervention design. Overall, compared with the waitlist (WL) condition, studies showed significant and sustained improvements in mental health outcomes following synchronous text-based intervention, and post treatment improvement equivalent but not superior to treatment as usual (TAU) (eg, face-to-face and telephone counseling). Conclusions: Feasibility studies indicate substantial innovation in this area of mental health intervention with studies utilizing trained volunteers and chatbot technologies to deliver interventions. While studies of efficacy show positive post-intervention gains, further research is needed to determine whether time requirements for this mode of intervention are feasible in clinical practice. },

              Question Answering (QA) systems enable users to retrieve exact answers for questions posed in natural language.
              Objective
              This study aims at identifying QA techniques, tools and systems, as well as the metrics and indicators used to measure these approaches for QA systems and also to determine how the relationship between Question Answering and natural language processing is built.
              Method
              The method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review of studies published from 2000 to 2017.
              Results
              130 out of 1842 papers have been identified as describing a QA approach developed and evaluated with different techniques.
              Conclusion
              Question Answering researchers have concentrated their efforts in natural language processing, knowledge base and information retrieval paradigms. Most of the researches focused on open domain. Regarding the metrics used to evaluate the approaches, Precision and Recall are the most addressed.}

abstract = {Semantic transformation of a natural language question into its corresponding logical form is crucial for knowledge-based question answering systems. Most previous methods have tried to achieve this goal by using syntax-based grammar formalisms and rule-based logical inference. However, these approaches are usually limited in terms of the coverage of the lexical trigger, which performs a mapping task from words to the logical properties of the knowledge base, and thus it is easy to ignore implicit and broken relations between properties by not interpreting the full knowledge base. In this study, our goal is to answer questions in any domains by using the semantic embedding space in which the embeddings encode the semantics of words and logical properties. In the latent space, the semantic associations between existing features can be exploited based on their embeddings without using a manually produced lexicon and rules. This embedding-based inference approach for question answering allows the mapping of factoid questions posed in a natural language onto logical representations of the correct answers guided by the knowledge base. In terms of the overall question answering performance, our experimental results and examples demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous knowledge-based question answering baseline methods with a publicly released question answering evaluation dataset: WebQuestions.}
